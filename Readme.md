# NetPractice

## Description

**NetPractice** is a practical networking project designed to develop a deep understanding
of how computer networks operate at a low level.

The project consists of solving a series of network configuration challenges where
hosts initially cannot communicate. Each challenge requires analyzing a network diagram
and correctly configuring IP addresses, subnet masks, routing tables, gateways, routers,
and switches so that traffic flows as expected.

Rather than focusing on tools or commands, NetPractice emphasizes **network reasoning**:
understanding how packets move through a network, how routers make forwarding decisions,
and why bidirectional routing is essential for successful communication.

## Instructions

### Running the Training Interface

1. Download the files attached to the NetPractice project page.
2. Extract them into a directory of your choice.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

The interface allows two modes:
- **Practice mode** by entering your 42 login, using a personal configuration
- **Evaluation mode**, which generates random configurations similar to official evaluations

---

### Using the Interface

- The project contains **10 progressive levels**.
- Each level displays a **non-functioning network diagram**.
- At the top of the page, one or more **communication goals** are shown.
- Only **unshaded fields** can be edited.

Available actions:
- **Check again** – validates the current configuration
- **Get my config** – exports the configuration file (used for submission)

When all goals of a level are met, the next level becomes available.

Helpful **logs** are displayed at the bottom of the interface, indicating common errors such
as missing gateways, invalid routes, or missing return paths.

---

### Submission Requirements

- All **10 exercises must be completed successfully**.
- The final configuration must be exported using **Get my config**.
- The exported file is used as the project submission.

## Technical Concepts Covered

Throughout the project, the following networking concepts were applied:

- TCP/IP addressing
- Subnet masks and CIDR notation
- Default gateways
- Static routing and routing tables
- Routers and switches
- Network interfaces
- Bidirectional routing and reverse path analysis
- OSI model (primarily Layers 2 and 3)
- Packet forwarding and next-hop logic

---

## Resources

### Networking References

- Internet Protocol (IP) documentation (RFCs)
- Cisco Networking Academy – Networking fundamentals
- Cloudflare Learning Center – Networking basics
- Subnetting and CIDR notation tutorials

---

### Use of AI

AI tools were used as a **learning aid** during this project, specifically for:
- Clarifying networking concepts and routing behavior
- Understanding why certain configurations failed
- Improving explanations and documentation clarity

AI was **not used to automatically generate network solutions**, but to support learning
and reinforce conceptual understanding.
